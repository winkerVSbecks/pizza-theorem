# 🍕 Theorem

React app to generate slices of a circle that satisfy the 🍕 theorem.

> Let p be an interior point of the disk, and let n be a number that is divisible by four and greater than or equal to eight. Form n sectors of the disk with equal angles by choosing an arbitrary line through p, rotating the line `n/2 − 1` times by an angle of `2π / n radians`, and slicing the disk on each of the resulting `n/2` lines. Number the sectors consecutively in a clockwise or anti-clockwise fashion. Then the pizza theorem states that:

> The sum of the areas of the odd numbered sectors equals the sum of the areas of the even numbered sectors.
